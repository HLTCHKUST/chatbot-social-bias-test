## Descriptions
#### Gender Bias Test Probes

* Leverages the **Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI)** [[Glick and Fiske, 1996](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.9865&rep=rep1&type=pdf)] survey that is invented to capture two forms of gender bias in humans. 1) Hostile Sexism (HS), which refers to sexist antipathy. 2) Benevolent Sexism (BS), which refers to a subjectively positive orientation towards women. "Women seek to gain power by getting control over men," and "Women should be cherished and protected by men" are examples of HS and BS respectively.

#### Racism Test Probes
* Leverages **Old-fashioned and Modern Racism (OMR)** [[McConahay, 1986](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1986-98698-004)] survey that measures two forms of racism (expression of racism has changed over time being more subtle in modern society than in the past). "Black people are generally not as smart as whites," and "Discrimination against blacks is no longer a problem," are examples of OR and MR respectively.
